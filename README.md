# Train Schedule

A simple train scheduler. User can input train name, destination, next arrival time and frequency. Minutes until arrival are calculated and displayed.

## Built With

[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - cloud database storage of train data

## Things to work on

1. Add date (day, month, year) for train schedule. 
2. Remove train when it "arrives"
3. Form verification for user inputs. Make sure inputs make sense.
4. Add train based on frequency of arrival once train "arrives"
